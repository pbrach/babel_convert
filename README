README:

1.) use "cod_conversion_helper" to quickly generate a list of file pathes
    where to find the cif files.
    For that specify the root directory where the cif-files reside in
    as first commandline arument. Also pipe the output of the tool into a 
    file that can then later used by "babel_convert". Call:

    ./cod_conversion_helper <CIF-rood dir> > temp_file

2.) use "babel_convert" to convert all CIFs specified in "temp_file".
    Call:

    ./babel_convert temp_file

    The result will be written to this folder into "conversion_out.sdf".
    It will contain all successfully converted structures.
    * hydrogens are removed
    * properties are deleted
    * connected components are separated into individual molecule entries

3.) You may use "remove_meta" strip the resulting sdf-files of the often
    wrong meta annotations that come from the babel-conversion process.
